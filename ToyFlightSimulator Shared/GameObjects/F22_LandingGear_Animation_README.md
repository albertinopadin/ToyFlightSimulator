# F22 Landing Gear Animation Implementation

## Overview
Modified the F22 aircraft to use rotation-based animation for landing gear instead of simple alpha fading between two mesh states.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Modified F22.swift
- Added rotation animation properties:
  - `gearRotationAngle`: Current rotation in radians
  - `maxRotationAngle`: 90 degrees maximum rotation
  - `animationElapsedTime`: Frame-rate independent timing
  - `animationDuration`: 3 seconds as requested

- Updated animation system:
  - Uses `GameTime.DeltaTime` for frame-rate independence
  - Implements smooth easing with `easeInOutCubic` function
  - Blends between extended and retracted meshes during rotation

### 2. Created F22_Enhanced.swift (Advanced Implementation)
- Separates landing gear meshes into individual GameObjects
- Applies actual rotation transforms around physically accurate pivot points
- Uses `MeshDisplay` wrapper class for mesh-specific rendering
- Implements proper transform hierarchy for rotation animation

## How It Works

### Animation Flow:
1. Press 'G' key to toggle landing gear
2. Animation runs for 3 seconds regardless of frame rate
3. During animation:
   - Rotation angle interpolates from 0° to 90° (or vice versa)
   - Alpha blending creates smooth visual transition
   - Easing function provides natural acceleration/deceleration

### Technical Details:
- **Pivot Point**: Approximated at `float3(0, 0, -10)` for main gear
- **Rotation Axis**: X-axis for sideways rotation (typical for F-22)
- **Easing**: Cubic in/out for smooth, natural motion
- **Frame Independence**: Uses `Float(GameTime.DeltaTime)` for consistent timing

## Usage

### Current Implementation (F22.swift):
```swift
let jet = CollidableF22(scale: 0.25)
```

### Enhanced Implementation (F22_Enhanced.swift):
To use the enhanced version with actual mesh rotation:
1. Add F22_Enhanced.swift to Xcode project
2. Use `F22_Enhanced` or create `CollidableF22_Enhanced`
3. The enhanced version provides cleaner separation of landing gear meshes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Separate Component Animation**:
   - Main gear vs nose gear with different timing
   - Landing gear doors opening/closing
   - Strut compression during touchdown

2. **Physics Integration**:
   - Collision detection during retraction
   - Weight-on-wheels detection
   - Hydraulic actuator simulation

3. **Sound Effects**:
   - Synchronized with animation progress
   - Different sounds for extension/retraction

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Emergency gear extension (gravity drop)
   - Partial deployment states
   - Gear position indicators

## Testing
- Build succeeded with the modified F22.swift
- Press 'G' key in-game to test landing gear animation
- Animation takes exactly 3 seconds regardless of frame rate
- Smooth transition between extended and retracted states
